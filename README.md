# CV Tech Team Website
This website is designed to make it easier for Student Tech Leaders (STLs) at CVHS to manage tech requests. The website also includes a front page, a submission page, and a learn page.

## Who Uses This Website
- STLs
- Teachers and Staff Members
- Students
- Parents

## How It Works
The JavaScript in the request page takes in a tech request and stores it in Firebase Firestore. The STLs page can then take this data and display it in a more visually appealing form.
